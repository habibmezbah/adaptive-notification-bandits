# adaptive-notification-bandits
Simulation-based project comparing A/B testing and bandit algorithms for adaptive notification scheduling under user fatigue, capturing delayed effects, opt-outs, and non-stationary user behavior. I did this project just to understand and learn these concepts. And best way to learn is to implement.
